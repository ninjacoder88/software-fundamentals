**What is debugging?**
Debugging comes from the days when computers used to take up entire rooms, had vaccuum tubs, filters, and such. Actual physical bugs used to get caught in the different components and would have to be removed.
Debugging today doesn't remove physical bugs but removes issues or bad logic from the code.

**How do you debug code?**
A piece of software called a debugger is used. The debugger "attaches" to the running code and allow a developer to step through the code line by line and inspect the state of the application. Breakpoints can be set to the code can run as normal until it hits a specific point in the code

**What is a breakpoint**
A specific point or line in the code that the developer would like the code to pause execution and inspect the state of the application

**Demo**
BasicDebuggingDemo
`Console.WriteLine();`

**What are functional breakpoints?**
Allow you to put a condition on a breakpoint that will only pause execution when the condition is hit

**What is the immediate window?**
A interactive debugging console that allows you to inspect and modify data at runtime
