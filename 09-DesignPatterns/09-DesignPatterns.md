**What is the proxy pattern?**
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
Wrap up functionality or surface it in another way. This can be done to limit to scope of resources or modify what a client can do.

**What is the strategy pattern?**
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it

**What is the factory pattern?**
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

**What is the builder pattern?**
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

**What is the mediator pattern?**
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently. 

**What is the facade pattern?**
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Fa√ßade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. 

**What is the decorator pattern?**
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
